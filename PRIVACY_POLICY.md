# Privacy Policy

**Pigment Studio**
**Effective Date: February 21, 2026**

Pigment Studio ("the App") is developed and operated by Yana Valieva ("I," "me," or "my"), an individual developer. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.

Pigment Studio was built with privacy in mind. The App works almost entirely on your device, and does not collect, store, or have access to your personal data.

---

## 1. What the App Does Not Collect

Pigment Studio does **not** collect personal information such as names, email addresses, location data, device identifiers, or biometric data.

---

## 2. Local Data

The App stores your saved color mixing recipes and custom paint palettes **locally on your device only**. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to anyone. You can delete it at any time within the App or by uninstalling the App.

---

## 3. Camera and Photo Library

Pigment Studio uses your camera and photo library solely to sample colors. Images are processed **in memory on your device only** to extract color values. You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device's Settings.

---

## 4. Purchases and Third-Party Services

Pigment Studio offers an optional Pro subscription. The only third-party services used are:

**Apple In-App Purchases** — All payment processing is handled by Apple. I do not receive your payment details. See [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

**RevenueCat** — I use RevenueCat to manage subscription status and validate purchase receipts. RevenueCat receives your purchase history and an anonymous identifier generated automatically by its SDK. I do not intentionally provide personal identifiers such as names or email addresses to RevenueCat. See [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/) for details on how they handle data.

Apple and RevenueCat may process data on servers located outside the European Union. Please refer to their Privacy Policies above for details.

---

## 5. Data Retention

Local data (recipes, palettes) is retained on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. Purchase data is retained by Apple and RevenueCat per their respective policies. I do not maintain any database of user data.

---

## 6. Your Rights

### GDPR (European Economic Area)

Because Pigment Studio does not collect or store personal data on any server, most data rights are satisfied by design — your local data is fully under your control. For data held by Apple or RevenueCat in connection with your subscription, please refer to their respective privacy policies.

**Legal basis for processing:** Contract performance (subscription payments).

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

### CCPA/CPRA (California)

Pigment Studio does **not sell or share your personal information** with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. You may contact me regarding any personal data that I control. For data processed solely by Apple or RevenueCat, please refer to their privacy policies.

---

## 7. Children's Privacy

Pigment Studio is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If I make material changes to this policy, I will update the Effective Date above. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

---

## 9. Contact

For data processed solely by Apple or RevenueCat, requests must be directed to those providers.
