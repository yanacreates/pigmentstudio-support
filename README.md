## What is Pigment Studio?

Pigment Studio is an iOS app that helps artists, beginners, and hobbyists mix acrylic paints to match any color from a photo. No guesswork, no muddy browns — just accurate recipes built on real pigment physics.

### How it works

1. **Snap or pick** a photo
2. **Pick** the color you want to match
3. **Get a recipe** — which paints to mix and in what ratio

That's it.

### Why it works

Under the hood, Pigment Studio uses the same physics-based approach professional color matchers rely on. The result: recipes that behave like real paint on a real palette.
