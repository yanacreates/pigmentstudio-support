**Effective Date: February 15, 2026**

Welcome to PigmentLab. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the PigmentLab mobile application ("App") operated by Yana Valieva or her affiliated entity ("we," "us," or "our").

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using PigmentLab, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are using the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

You consent to receive communications from us electronically, including any notices, agreements, or disclosures required by law.

## 2. Description of Service

PigmentLab is a color mixing and matching application that helps users create paint mixing recipes based on colors sampled from photos. The App uses computational methods to suggest pigment combinations and ratios.

**PigmentLab is intended for entertainment, educational, and creative reference purposes only.** The App does not provide professional advice. Color mixing suggestions are generated by algorithmic processes and may not always be accurate or produce the intended results. You should always use your own experience, judgment, and expertise before following any suggestions provided by the App.

## 3. Eligibility and Age Requirements

You must be at least 13 years of age to use PigmentLab. If you are between 13 and 18 years of age (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction), you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will delete it promptly.

---

## 4. User Accounts

PigmentLab does not require you to create an account. All palettes, recipes, and preferences you create are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not backed up to our servers.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and any data stored within the App. We are not responsible for any loss of data resulting from device failure, App deletion, operating system updates, or any other cause.

## 5. Photo and Camera Usage

PigmentLab accesses your device's camera and photo library solely to allow you to sample colors from images. All photo processing occurs entirely on your device. We do not upload, transmit, store, or access your photos on any server.

Photos you capture or select are used only for real-time color sampling within the App and are not retained by the App after you navigate away from the sampling screen.

You are solely responsible for the images you choose to use with the App. We do not review, moderate, or endorse any content you select. The App extracts color data only and does not evaluate the nature or appropriateness of your images.

## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties

PigmentLab is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

**Important:** PigmentLab is for entertainment and reference purposes only. The App provides suggestions generated by computational methods based on color theory models. These processes attempt to find approximate solutions and may not always produce accurate or optimal results.

Actual paint mixing results may vary significantly due to differences in paint brands, pigment formulations, pigment quality, color batch variations, application techniques, surface materials, lighting conditions, color perception, and numerous other factors beyond our control.

You should always rely on your own experience, judgment, and expertise when mixing paints. The App is not a substitute for artistic skill or professional knowledge. You are solely responsible for evaluating the App's suggestions and for your paint mixing decisions and results.
